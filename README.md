     Hacktoberfest is the monthlong celebration of open source software created by DigitalOcean to honor and uplift the community that we owe a great deal to. From the very early days of DigitalOcean, weâ€™ve strived to invest time and money into open source foundations, projects, and maintainers.Itâ€™s especially important for all of us to come together for Hacktoberfest in 2020 while the world undergoes so much change. All of us have been directly impacted â€” in unique ways â€” by the global pandemic and its rippling effects on our everyday lives. â€¦

Benefits of contributing to open source?
Contributing to open source can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, meet people who are interested in similar things, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine,

Working with others on a shared project means youâ€™ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.

By definition, all of your open source work is public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.

Whether itâ€™s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if youâ€™re looking for practice, thereâ€™s a task for you on an open-source project.

If youâ€™re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you find the right project? What if you donâ€™t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?

Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open-source project
